## Project Status
The project is currently in a very early stage of development. While the basic functionality has been implemented, there are still various tasks and enhancements to be addressed.

## Description
The project consists of a custom module that integrates with the OpenAI API to generate summaries using the text-davinci-003 model. The module primarily focuses on the manipulation of the body field.

## Functionality
The module performs the following tasks:

Checks for the existence of the body field.
If the body field is found, it adds a "OpenAI Summary" button.
Clicking the button triggers the generation of a summary using the OpenAI text-davinci-003 model.
Configuration
To use the module, the OpenAI API Key needs to be configured. This can be done on the settings page located at `/admin/config/system/openai-stuff`.

Please note that further development and improvements are required to enhance the functionality and stability of the module.
